<!-- Easy Challenge: Nonrepeating Character
Using the JavaScript language, have the function NonrepeatingCharacter(str) take the str parameter being passed, which will contain only alphabetic characters and spaces, and return the first non-repeating character. For example: if str is "agettkgaeee" then your program should return k. The string will always contain at least one character and there will always be at least one non-repeating character. 
Sample Test Cases
Input:"abcdef"
Output:"a"

Input:"hello world hi hey"
Output:"w" -->
