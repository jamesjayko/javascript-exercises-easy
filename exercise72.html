<!-- Easy Challenge: String Merge
Using the JavaScript language, have the function StringMerge(str) read the str parameter being passed which will contain a large string of alphanumeric characters with a single asterisk character splitting the string evenly into two separate strings. Your goal is to return a new string by pairing up the characters in the corresponding locations in both strings. For example: if str is "abc1*kyoo" then your program should return the string akbyco1o because a pairs with k, b pairs with y, etc. The string will always split evenly with the asterisk in the center.
Sample Test Cases
Input:"aaa*bbb"
Output:"ababab"

Input:"123hg*aaabb"
Output:"1a2a3ahbgb" -->
