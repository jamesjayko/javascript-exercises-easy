<!-- Easy Challenge: One Decremented
Using the JavaScript language, have the function OneDecremented(num) count how many times a digit appears that is exactly one less than the previous digit. For example: if num is 5655984 then your program should return 2 because 5 appears directly after 6 and 8 appears directly after 9. The input will always contain at least 1 digit.
